            <p>
              Summit Legal Group was founded in 1999 by David Chen with a clear vision: to provide
              Denver families and individuals with the same caliber of legal representation typically
              reserved for large corporations. What started as a one-attorney practice in a small
              downtown office has grown into one of the Denver metro area's most respected law firms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the past two decades, we've built our reputation case by case, client by client.
              We've recovered over $50 million for injured victims, reunited families through complex
              custody proceedings, defended the wrongly accused, and helped thousands of Coloradans
              protect what matters most.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, our team of experienced attorneys continues that founding mission. We combine
              decades of courtroom experience with a genuine commitment to every person who walks
              through our doors. At Summit, you're never just a case number — you're family.
